# Assessing Networking and Cybersecurity

### What do I know?
In Networking and Cybersecurity, I have developed a strong foundation in several key areas, each essential to maintaining secure digital environments and mitigating potential threats.

#### Network Security
I have acquired practical experience in designing and securing network infrastructures through firewalls, VPNs, and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS). My understanding of network security protocols allows me to identify vulnerabilities and protect data and devices within a network from cyber threats. This includes ensuring the secure transmission of data, implementing encryption measures, and maintaining the integrity of endpoints across various network systems. I am skilled in configuring and maintaining systems that uphold the integrity and reliability of networks, ensuring that they remain resilient to internal and external attacks.

#### Cloud Security
In addition to securing traditional networks, I have also developed a proficiency in cloud security, focusing on safeguarding cloud environments from unauthorized access and potential breaches. My experience involves implementing access controls, encryption protocols, and secure data storage practices tailored to the unique challenges of cloud platforms. I have developed a clear understanding of cloud security vulnerabilities, such as misconfigurations and unauthorized access, and how to mitigate these risks by applying security best practices. My knowledge extends across various cloud platforms, ensuring data integrity and security in distributed environments where cloud-based services are used for operations and data storage.

#### Ransomware Recovery
Ransomware is a growing threat, and my expertise includes strategies for preventing and recovering from such attacks. I have developed and implemented backup and disaster recovery solutions that help organizations restore operations with minimal disruption following a ransomware incident. My experience includes detecting ransomware behavior, isolating infected systems, and restoring critical data to mitigate damage. Moreover, I have taken steps to prevent future incidents by hardening systems, improving backup processes, and deploying security measures to detect ransomware activity before it can fully infiltrate a network.

### Where Am I Weak?
I intend to broaden my expertise in advanced threat detection and response, particularly in utilizing behavioral analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) for proactive threat management. Acquiring proficiency in these state-of-the-art techniques will enable me to address more complex cyber threats effectively, ensuring faster and more precise responses to potential breaches.

While I am acquainted with basic principles in cloud security, I aim to deepen my understanding of cloud-native security tools and platforms such as AWS Shield, Azure Security Center, and Google Cloud Security Command Center. These tools are crucial for developing resilient, scalable cloud security solutions, and furthering my proficiency in them will empower me to construct comprehensive security frameworks for cloud environments.

Furthermore, despite having experience in ransomware recovery, I intend to strengthen my capabilities in formalizing incident response procedures. This encompasses creating detailed incident response plans encompassing the entire process, from detection and analysis to containment, eradication, and post-incident activities. Doing so will make me better prepared to manage security incidents methodically and efficiently, minimizing the overall impact on operations.

In conclusion, my existing skills in Networking and Cybersecurity provide a solid foundation for further growth. I am committed to expanding my knowledge to address the evolving challenges of the cybersecurity landscape. My dedication to continuous learning ensures that I am always prepared to face the next cybersecurity challenge.

### What Do I Wish I Knew?
I am deeply committed to broadening my expertise in various critical areas of networking and cybersecurity to tackle the challenges presented by modern IT landscapes effectively. My primary objective is to master advanced cloud security techniques, focusing on adeptly managing multi-cloud environments and ensuring consistent security across prominent platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Additionally, I am dedicated to deepening my comprehension of zero-trust architecture to bolster network security in remote and distributed computing contexts.

Furthermore, I am eager to delve into automated threat intelligence and security orchestration, as these capabilities enable real-time detection and response to cyber threats. By harnessing tools that automate detection and streamline incident responses, I aim to stay proactively ahead of evolving threats.

Lastly, I am enthusiastic about enhancing my grasp of cybersecurity governance and compliance frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. This knowledge will be instrumental in ensuring that my security strategies protect data and align with global regulatory requirements, thereby enabling the development of more resilient and compliant security solutions.

### Summary Statement
I have a strong background in network and cloud security, as well as ransomware recovery, allowing me to safeguard networks and systems effectively. My experience includes configuring firewalls, VPNs, and intrusion detection systems to protect network infrastructures while implementing encryption and secure access controls to secure cloud environments.

My commitment to staying ahead of cybersecurity threats is unwavering. I have developed strategies for ransomware recovery, focusing on disaster recovery and preventive measures to minimize future risks. As the threat landscape continues to evolve, I am dedicated to expanding my expertise in advanced threat detection, particularly through AI and machine learning, and gaining deeper knowledge of cloud-native security tools like AWS Shield and Azure Security Center. Additionally, I aim to strengthen my incident response planning, ensuring comprehensive protection and rapid recovery from security incidents.

### Preparedness for Portfolio and Capstone
Throughout my academic journey, I have actively engaged in a wide range of projects and practical experiences that have allowed me to refine and enhance my proficiency in networking, cybersecurity, and data analytics. As I approach the capstone project, I am well-prepared to leverage this comprehensive skill set to develop a compelling portfolio and prototype. These deliverables will serve as a robust showcase of my ability to tackle complex, real-world problems in these domains, instilling confidence in my expertise and innovative problem-solving capabilities.

### Contribution Towards the Capstone
Networking and Cybersecurity are essential for improving an organization's data analytics efforts. When these areas are combined, businesses can enhance their capability to recognize and respond to threats by examining patterns in large datasets, thus more effectively pinpointing potential vulnerabilities and emerging threats. Incorporating machine learning algorithms into cybersecurity tools can support automated threat detection and proactive risk management. This fusion allows systems to predict and deal with threats in real time, leading to more robust defenses and reduced risk of data breaches.
